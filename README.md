# Flutter Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a chat application developed using Flutter. It serves as a laboratory exercise for university, focusing on implementing various functionalities commonly found in chat applications. The project demonstrates the use of Flutter and related technologies to create a mobile application capable of real-time messaging.

## Features

- **Basic Chat Functionality**: Users can send and receive text messages in real time.
- **Custom Chat UI**: Implemented using the `flutter_chat_ui` package, providing a user-friendly interface for chat interactions.
- **Message Handling**: Includes sending, receiving, and displaying messages within the chat interface.
- **Nickname Display**: Messages show the sender's nickname above each message, differentiating between the current user and others.
- **File Attachment Feature**: A feature to attach files in messages, similar to popular messaging apps like Telegram. (Note: This is a UI feature; actual file handling/backend integration is not implemented.)
- **Custom Input Field**: A text input field with an additional button for attaching files, enhancing the chat functionality.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
3. **Open and Run**: Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and run the application using a Flutter-supported device or emulator.

## Usage

- **Sending Messages**: Type your message in the input field and tap the send button to send a message.
- **Attaching Files**: Tap the attach button (paperclip icon) to simulate attaching a file. (Note: This functionality is UI-only in the current implementation.)

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For creating the cross-platform mobile application.
- **flutter_chat_ui**: A Flutter package used for the chat interface.

## Project Structure

- **lib/main.dart**: The entry point of the application containing the main chat UI and logic.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
